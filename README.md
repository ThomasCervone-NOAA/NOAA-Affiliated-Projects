### [National Geodetic Survey (NGS)](https://github.com/noaa-ngs)

NOAA's National Geodetic Survey (NGS) defines, maintains, and provides access to the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) - a consistent coordinate system that defines latitude, longitude, height, scale, gravity, orientation, and shoreline throughout the United States and is designed to meet our nation~Rs economic, social, and environmental needs.

For 200 years, NGS and its predecessor agencies have collaborated with public and private organizations to establish reference stations at precisely determined locations. Traditionally, these locations have been identified by setting a survey mark - usually a brass, bronze, or aluminum disk. Locations might also be identified by a deeply driven rod or a prominent object, such as a water tower or church spire. More recently, NGS has fostered a network of continuously operating reference stations (CORS) where each CORS includes a highly accurate receiver that continuously collects radio signals broadcast by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites.

### [Marine Spatial Ecology Division (MSE)](https://github.com/MSE-NCCOS-NOAA)

Coastal communities need to balance the inherent trade-offs between resource use and conservation. Managers need comprehensive information to evaluate the benefits and consequences of actions on both the ecosystem and the community. Marine Spatial Ecology (MSE) integrates a broad spectrum of physical, biological, and social sciences, to inform coastal and marine decision making. Communities, state and federal stewards, and industries such as aquaculture, offshore energy, and tourism use MSE to make decisions so that the economy can thrive and residents and visitors can enjoy our nation’s natural heritage, now and for generations to come.

NCCOS has long been a leader in the MSE community, providing a three-decade foundation of reliable and objective ecological and socioeconomic information. NCCOS scientists will continue to provide integrated biogeographic, ecological and social assessments – alongside mapping and monitoring products and services – to provide an end-to-end MSE enterprise in support of customers in the coastal and ocean management community. These unique capabilities are used by federal, state, and local decision makers to ensure that special places are valued, protected, and preserved, and to assist in growing the economies that are dependent on our nation’s maritime resources.

### [NCCOS HAB Forecasting Branch](https://github.com/HABF-SDI-NCCOS-NOAA)

The Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting (HAB-F) branch within NOAA’s [National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS)](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/) delivers near real-time harmful algal bloom (HAB) [monitoring](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/science-areas/habs/hab-monitoring-system/) and [forecasting](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/science-areas/habs/hab-forecasts/) products for predicting the intensity/severity, location, and respiratory health risk HABs pose in the Great Lakes and coastal regions of the U.S. While HAB-F’s monitoring, forecasting, and research efforts are national in scope, products often target specific regions based on localized needs and problems. Importantly, HAB monitoring and forecasting products require an understanding of the drivers for specific HAB species including weather, oceanographic, and environmental conditions, all of which vary greatly by region. Ultimately, HAB-F products serve as decision-support tools and provide early warning of HABs for local resource managers, public health officials, researchers, and the general public.

### [NOAA 'Omics Github Repositories](https://github.com/NOAA-Omics/NOAA-Omics)
'Omics describes a suite of cutting-edge tools used to analyze DNA, RNA, proteins, or metabolites. Many 'Omics approaches are faster, less invasive, and more comprehensive than traditional methods. Advances in 'Omics have revolutionized biological study, benefitting many fields including public health, medicine, agriculture, and conservation. For NOAA, techniques such as high-throughput DNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analyses can be harnessed to benefit a myriad of national priorities including fisheries management, aquaculture development, food and water safety, species and habitat conservation, seafood consumer protection, biodiversity monitoring, and natural products discovery. Continued investment in NOAA 'Omics will aid operational efficiency, ecosystem assessments and forecasts, and the U.S. Blue Economy.
